The resulting online capability description is a self-contained, valid OpenAPI specification. The description contains information which refers to the creation, reading, updating or deleting of the respective element and its direct child elements as defined by the SOVD standard. An online capability description is requested for a data resource /{entity-path}/data/{data-id} via GET /{entity-path}/data/{data-id}/docs. For example, to enrich the responses with additional details such as the underlying schema of the response using the “include-schema” query parameter on the request. Moreover, for each supported HTTP method all defined HTTP response status codes are documented together with the data model of the resulting response payloads.'

In addition, an SOVD client shall provide a relative expiration time after which the SOVD server should release the lock automatically. The SOVD server might reject the requested expiration time if it is too long. As a result, the SOVD server deletes the corresponding lock resource.'

        The method starts the installation and activation of the update package. As part of this step the following tasks are performed for example:
          - Validation if the update package is still installable (e.g., checking the software versions of the updated entities)
          - Installation of the update on all updated entities
          - Configuration of the entities
          - Execution of specific post install actions
          - Activation of the update (e.g., by switching to B-memory)
          - Rollback of update in case of an error

        The method returns immediately and redirects the SOVD client to a method for requesting the status and progress of the installation. After the update has been finished, the resource for the update package (and its sub-resources like status) remains existent and an SOVD client can receive the status of an update package. However, the status of the update package cannot be queried indefinitely as an SOVD server implementation may remove the update package resource, e.g., upon SOVD server restart or the retrieval of new update packages.

        The method starts the preparation of the update package for installation. As part of this step the following tasks are performed for example:
          - Validates if the update package is still installable (e.g., checking the software versions of the affected entities)
          - Download of update package from OTA backend
          - Validation of the integrity of update package
          - Applying deltas
          - Installing the update in B-memory

        The method returns immediately and redirects the SOVD client to a method for requesting the status and progress of the preparation. An SOVD server may remove prepared updates after an OEM defined amount of time. An explicit removal of a prepared update by an SOVD client is not provided by the SOVD API as the update is implicitly removed after installation. If an update fails, it is in general not implicitly removed as the prepared package may be used for anoth
